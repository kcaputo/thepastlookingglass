How We Did It: Our last project, on the average woman and the change in the average woman over time, left us with one question: Was it different for different races? We set out to find an answer to that. First, we had to collect all of the data. Our workforce data came from the Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics:http://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/LForce_Race_Hispanic_Ethnicity_72_12_txt.htmhttp://www.dol.gov/wb/stats/facts_over_time.htm Then, we cleaned that up. The marital data came from the Census Bureau, then we cleaned that up: https://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p20-365.pdf The data on age of motherhood came from the CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db232.htm It took quite some time to find all of the data, contact the Census Bureau, and clean it up for our purposes in Google spreadsheets. We then used DataWrapper to make all of our charts and graphs, deciding on a purple color scheme because pink for girls was cliche! But that was just the average data. We wanted to know about real women in the 1980's. We interviwed three women who spoke about their time in the 1980's, one in California and two in New York, of three races. We interviewed these three women, then compared their stories to the average stories for their race. Once this was accomplished, we put it together for our story. After that, we created a Github page using Foundation. And that's how we made it!
