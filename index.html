In the 1980s, the average 25-year-old woman was working, educated, married, and had their first kid. Flash forward to 2016, and the average 25-year-old woman might be working and educated, but isn’t necessarily married or a mother, and might even still be living at home. The average woman might’ve changed over time, but that doesn’t mean that all women have changed in the same way. Broken down by race, the average woman is a lot different. So while 22% of 25 year old white women might have had a college degree, only 12.5% of black women did. We spoke to three women of each race who explain what life was like for them when they were our age. 
Read their stories, and use the interactive graphs to compare the average woman to a breakdown of women by race.

<b>THE AVERAGE WHITE WOMAN</b><br>
Mary Roccaro is a married mother of two, and recalls the 1980s as being “pretty uneventful.”
Just as 51.2% of white women were working in 1985, Roccaro worked her way through the 1980’s. 
“My first job out of college was at a women’s healthcare facility in Manhattan,” Roccaro, a Stony Brook University graduate, said. 
Things changed when Roccaro and her husband decided to settle down when she was 25- just like 72% of white women her age had at that time.
“At 25, I quit there because we were buying a house in East Islip and I didn’t want that far of a commute,” Roccaro said. “I went to work as an office manager in an electronics manufacturing facility.” 
Roccaro has worked steadily since then, now working as an office administrator
She reflected the trends of the average woman, living with her parents until she was 25.

<br><i>Mary and her daughter Kristyn, now</i><br>
“I lived with my parents until I got married at 25,” Roccaro said. “We were able to buy a house a few months before we got married, and Tom lived there full time, and I stayed there on weekends.”
But when it came to having kids, Roccaro was a little later than the average, having her first daughter, Kristyn, when she was 29. 
And her oldest daughter is reflecting the trend of the current average white woman now.
At 23, she is single with no children, living at home, and has a college degree from SUNY Binghamton, as well as a full-time job as a fitness instructor, showing how things have changed.

<br><i></i>Lisa and her daughter, now</i><br>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
