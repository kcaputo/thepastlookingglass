In the 1980s, the average 25-year-old woman was working, educated, married, and had their first kid. 
<br>Flash forward to 2016, and the average 25-year-old woman might be working and educated, but isn’t necessarily married or a mother, and might even still be living at home. 
<p>The average woman might’ve changed over time, but that doesn’t mean that all women have changed in the same way. Broken down by race, the average woman is a lot different. 
<p>So while 22% of 25 year old white women might have had a college degree, only 12.5% of black women did. 
<p>Three women of three different races share their experiences during the 1980's- when they were the age that their daughters are now. 
<p>Read their stories, and use the interactive graphs to compare the average woman to a breakdown of women by race.

<b>THE AVERAGE WHITE WOMAN</b><br>
Mary Roccaro is a married mother of two, and recalls the 1980s as being “pretty uneventful.”<br>
Just as 51.2% of white women were working in 1985, Roccaro worked her way through the 1980’s. <br>
“My first job out of college was at a women’s healthcare facility in Manhattan,” Roccaro, a Stony Brook University graduate, said. <br>
Things changed when Roccaro and her husband decided to settle down when she was 25- just like 72% of white women her age had at that time.
<br>“At 25, I quit there because we were buying a house in East Islip and I didn’t want that far of a commute,” Roccaro said. “I went to work as an office manager in an electronics manufacturing facility.” 
<br>Roccaro has worked steadily since then, now working as an office administrator
<br>She reflected the trends of the average woman, living with her parents until she was 25.

<br><i>Mary and her daughter Kristyn, now</i><br>
“I lived with my parents until I got married at 25,” Roccaro said. “We were able to buy a house a few months before we got married, and Tom lived there full time, and I stayed there on weekends.”
<br>But when it came to having kids, Roccaro was a little later than the average, having her first daughter, Kristyn, when she was 29. 
<br>And her oldest daughter is reflecting the trend of the current average white woman now.
<br>At 23, she is single with no children, living at home, and has a college degree from SUNY Binghamton, as well as a full-time job as a fitness instructor, showing how things have changed.

<b>THE AVERAGE SPANISH-ORIGIN WOMAN</b><br>
Lisa M. is a divorced mother of three who spent her teenage years in the 1980s. She experienced little issues pertaining to her Cuban heritage growing up in South East L.A. 
<br>“We were like minded and raised in the same way culturally,” she said of her neighborhood. 
<br>A majority of her childhood was spent attending Cuban dances and playing games with other children in the area. It wasn’t until she moved at the age of 16 to Orange County, a mainly white neighborhood, that she experienced a culture shock, in losing her friends, that caused her to become more of an introvert. 
<br>Like the other 47.4% of women of spanish-origin, Lisa worked hard, starting at the age of 15 as an ice cream scooper at the local ice cream shop. 
<br><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kcaputo/thepastlookingglass/gh-pages/lisa1.jpg" alt="Lisa and her daughter now" style="width:150px;height:120px;"> 
<br><i>Lisa and her daughter, now</i><br> 
<br>Unlike the 52-49% of women of spanish-origin who didn’t have a high school diploma, Lisa graduated from high school into the medical field as a receptionist before working for Shiseido, a japanese cosmetic company. 
<br>And unlike 77.1% of women of spanish-origin, Lisa got married young at just 18 years old and moved out her parents home for the first time. 
<br>She believes it is due to becoming an introvert that she clinged to her first boyfriend instead of exploring other relationships in her young adulthood. 
<br>In doing so, she gained a step-daugher before having two biological children of her own, the first at 21 and the second at 25. 
<br>“I always made it really clear to them that there is really no clear path about growing up,” she said. 
<br>Lisa explained that she was always very open and willing to explain to her children about everything including sex, drugs and alcohol. 
<br>Now at age 45, Lisa has gone into real-estate, earning her broker’s license in 2009. As for her children?
<br>“In no way shape or form are they living the life I did,” she said. Her youngest daughter, Sydnee, 20, is currently studying Mechanical Engineering at University of Notre Dame. “I want her to have a career,” said Lisa “I want her to try things out.” </p>

 <br><b>THE AVERAGE BLACK WOMAN</b><br>
As a now married mother of two, Andrea Miller first moved to America from Jamaica when she was about 10 years old. The 1980s were a busy time in her life, where during her young adult years she moved out of her mother’s house for the first time, got married, had her first child and broke through in a new career field. 
Back in the 1980s computers were still relatively new, Andrea was in the small percentage, 6.1%, of black women who had their college degree by age 24, with a degree in Business Computer Information Systems. Now as a Programmer Analyst 3, Andrea has continued her studies through specialized training and certifications which is something she wanted to do to continue to move up in the field. Though she was one of few women who were in her field at the time, she can’t remember experiencing any challenges based on both her gender and ethnicity.
<br><img src="https://github.com/kcaputo/thepastlookingglass/blob/gh-pages/miller1.jpg?raw=trueg" alt="Andrea and her family" style="width:150px;height:120px;"> 
<br><i>Andrea with her daughter</i><br>“I think it is because I never felt like anyone owed me anything,” she said. 
Before she finished college, Andrea met and married her husband, Tony Miller, when she was just 23, falling in the middle with 28.7% of black women who got married around the same age. It was at this time that Andrea also moved out of her parents home and into a small apartment with her husband in Rockville Centre, where she paid $400 a month for rent. Together, they had their first child, Lauren Miller, in 1989, when Andrea was 27, and their second child, Stephanie Miller, in 1992, when Andrea was 29. This was a little later in life compared to most black women who had their first child between 21 and 22. 
Andrea says the biggest challenge she experienced didn’t have to do with her ethnicity but her decision to become a Christian in a non-Christian household. While she remembers not being received well once her family moved to Rosedale, a mainly white neighborhood, when she was 11, she said they people eventually got over it, realizing they weren’t there to cause any trouble. “I always felt it was their problem not mine,” she said. 
She feels her daughters both have a better life because she raised them in a Christian household and sent them to private school. Her daughter, Stephanie, 23, is currently attending graduate school at Northeastern University for Audiology in Boston, Massachusetts where she lives on her own. Much like the average black woman today, Stephanie is not married, has not children and works a full time job while attending school.
